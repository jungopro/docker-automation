# Artifactory Docker Compose Examples
This directory provides some examples that show different ways to run Artifactory with Docker Compose.  


## Docker and Docker Compose
To learn more about Docker and how to set it up, please refer to the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) documentation.  
 

## Artifactory Docker Images
Artifactory is available as different Docker images for:
- [Artifactory Pro](#artifactory-pro-and-ha)
- [Artifactory OSS](#artifactory-oss)

These images are available for download from [JFrog Bintray](https://bintray.com/jfrog).

 

## Docker Compose Examples
To run any of the examples, you should execute:  
```bash
$ docker-compose -f <compose-file> <options>
```


### Docker Compose Control Commands
**NOTE:** On **OSX**, you should omit the `sudo` from all your `docker-compose` commands


- Start  
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f <compose-file> up -d
```
- Stop  
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f <compose-file> stop
```
- Restart  
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f <compose-file> restart
```
- Status  
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f <compose-file> ps
```
- Logs  
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f <compose-file> logs
```
- Remove  
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f <compose-file> rm
```

### Persistent Storage
For persistent storage, all volumes are mounted from the host.  
All examples default to the host's **/data** directory  
**IMPORTANT:** You should create the directories on the host before running `docker-compose`.
- Artifactory data: **/data/artifactory**
  - In the case of HA, you need to create a data directory for each node: **/data/artifactory/node1** and **/data/artifactory/node2**
  - In the case of HA with shared data storage, you need to create the shared data and backup directories: **/data/artifactory/ha** and **/data/artifactory/backup**
- PostgreSQL data: **/data/postgresql**
- NginX
  - Logs: **/data/nginx/log**
  - SSL: **/data/nginx/ssl**

To help with setting up of directories and files for Artifactory Pro and HA, there is a helper script [prepareHostEnv.sh](prepareHostEnv.sh) you should run.  
This script prepares the needed directories on the host and populates them with example files.
Get the usage by running it with `-h`
```bash
sudo ./prepareHostEnv.sh -h
```
After executing the script, the needed set of data directories for Artifactory Pro or HA will be created under **/data** (on Mac it defaults to **~/.artifactory**).

### Database Driver
The database used in these examples is PostgreSQL.  
The PostgreSQL database driver comes pre-loaded into the Artifactory Docker image, but you can still use other databases without any conflicts. 

#### Using Different Databases
Artifactory can run with other databases. For more details on supported databases and how to set them up for use with Artifactory, please refer to [Changing the Database](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Changing+the+Database) in the JFrog Artifactory Use Guide.

### Examples
Below is a list of included examples. You are welcome to contribute.

**IMPORTANT:** The files under the `files` directory included in this repository are for example purposes only and should NOT be used for any production deployments!

### Artifactory Pro and HA
Artifactory Pro and HA require some more setup due to the built in support for simple and complex configurations.  


### Artifactory Pro with PostgreSQL and Nginx for Docker registry support
```bash
### Linux
$ sudo ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t pro -c
$ sudo docker-compose -f artifactory-pro.yml up -d

### OSX
$ ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t pro -c
$ sed -i.bk "s,/data/,~/.artifactory/,g" artifactory-pro.yml
$ docker-compose -f artifactory-pro.yml up -d

```  

This example starts the following containers

- Nginx exposed on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https)
  - You can disable port 80 in Nginx's configuration files
  - Nginx comes with self signed SSL certificates [that can be overwritten](NginxSSL.md)
- Artifactory Pro exposed on port 8081
- PostgreSQL database serving Artifactory   


### Artifactory Pro with PostgreSQL only 
```bash
### Linux
$ sudo ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t pro -c
$ sudo docker-compose -f artifactory-pro-postgresql.yml up -d

### OSX
$ ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t pro -c
$ sed -i.bk "s,/data/,~/.artifactory/,g" artifactory-pro-postgresql.yml
$ docker-compose -f artifactory-pro-postgresql.yml up -d
```  

This example starts the following containers

- Artifactory Pro exposed on port 80
- PostgreSQL database serving Artifactory   

Artifactory uses the PostgreSQL database running in another container.


### Artifactory Pro with Derby and Nginx for Docker registry support
```bash
$ sudo ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t pro -c
$ sudo docker-compose -f artifactory-pro-nginx-derby.yml up -d
```  

This example starts the following containers

- Nginx exposed on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https)
  - You can disable port 80 in Nginx's configuration files
  - Nginx comes with self signed SSL certificates [that can be overwritten](NginxSSL.md)
- Artifactory Pro exposed on port 8081  

Artifactory uses the Derby database at it container.

### Artifactory HA with PostgreSQL and Nginx for Docker registry and load balancing support
```bash
### Linux
$ sudo ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t ha -c
$ sudo docker-compose -f artifactory-ha.yml up -d

### OSX
$ ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t ha -c
$ sed -i.bk "s,/data/,~/.artifactory/,g" artifactory-ha.yml
$ docker-compose -f artifactory-ha.yml up -d
```  

This example starts the following containers

- Nginx exposed on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https)
  - You can disable port 80 in Nginx's configuration files
  - Nginx comes with self signed SSL certificates [that can be overwritten](NginxSSL.md)
  - Nginx is configured to load balance between the two Artifactory instances
- Artifactory primary exposed on port 8081 using its own data storage
- Artifactory node exposed on port 8082 using its own data storage
- PostgreSQL database serving Artifactory  

Artifactory data is stored on a binary store provider and no shared NFS is needed.  
In this example, the HA nodes use their local storage and sync data between the nodes. 

**NOTE:** You must complete the onboarding process to have a fully functional Artifactory HA cluster!

### Artifactory HA with PostgreSQL and Nginx for Docker registry and load balancing support with shared data storage (NFS)
```bash
### Linux
$ sudo ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t ha-shared-data -c
$ sudo docker-compose -f artifactory-ha-shared-data.yml up -d

### OSX
$ ./prepareHostEnv.sh -t ha-shared-data -c
$ sed -i.bk "s,/data/,~/.artifactory/,g" artifactory-ha-shared-data.yml
$ docker-compose -f artifactory-ha-shared-data.yml up -d
```

This example starts the following containers

- Nginx exposed on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https)
  - You can disable port 80 in Nginx's configuration files
  - Nginx comes with self signed SSL certificates [that can be overwritten](NginxSSL.md)
  - Nginx is configured to load balance the two Artifactory instances
- Artifactory primary exposed on port 8081
- Artifactory node exposed on port 8082
- PostgreSQL database serving Artifactory

Artifactory data is shared on a common NFS mount.

**NOTE:** You must complete the onboarding process to have a fully functional Artifactory HA cluster!

### Artifactory OSS

### Artifactory OSS standalone with built in Derby database
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f artifactory-oss.yml up -d
```
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to prepare the needed [storage for persistent data](#persistent-storage)!

This example starts the following containers

- Artifactory OSS exposed on port 80  

Artifactory uses the embedded DerbyDB database.


### Artifactory OSS with PostgreSQL
```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f artifactory-oss-postgresql.yml up -d
```
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to prepare the needed [storage for persistent data](#persistent-storage)!

This example starts the following containers

- Artifactory OSS exposed on port 80
- PostgreSQL database serving Artifactory   

Artifactory uses the PostgreSQL database running in another container.
